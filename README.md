# 🥚 aether

A simple multiegg that's highly configurable (in my opinion), all for free and open source!

aether is a multiegg designed to simply server management for hosting providers. Currently, it only supports Minecraft, but more may come soon.

## Features
there's not alot of impressive features, but some of them might be useful such as:
* built-in rules: when enabled, the first boot of a server will show them rules to comply with a confirmation
* set MCJars API Key: track some stats like the total requests, and even block some server software from there!
* forced MOTD: put your hosting name on their server's MOTD! this does not block plugins that interact with the MOTD such as [MiniMOTD](https://modrinth.com/plugin/minimotd) or [AdvancedServerList](https://modrinth.com/plugin/advancedserverlist)

any ideas you may wanna see? [create an issue!](https://github.com/amogusreal69/aether/issues/new)
